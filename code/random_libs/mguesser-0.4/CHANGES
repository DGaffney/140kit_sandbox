06 March 2008: 0.4
------------------

* -d command line option was added, to load language
maps from a non-default directory. A colon-separated
list of directories is also supported. Thanks to
Era Eriksson for the idea and for the original patch.

* -t command line option was added, to specify how
many top n-grams to print into the output map. The
default value is 200. You can decrease the default
value, or increase the default value (up to 4096).
Longer map files give better detection quality,
however work slower.

* About 30 new model maps were added.
